# Titanic EDA Examples

Sample outputs demonstrating data-analysis + frontend-design integration for exploratory data analysis.

## Files

- `titanic_eda.html` - EDA report in English
- `titanic_eda_ja.html` - EDA report in Japanese

## How These Were Created

These reports were generated using:

1. **data-analysis** - SQL queries on the Titanic dataset via DuckDB
2. **frontend-design** - HTML report generation with modern styling

The workflow demonstrates how MCP servers can be combined to analyze data and produce polished visual outputs.
